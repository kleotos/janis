            Did you know there’s a new neck pain relief device that uses
            “cervical traction” to fix desk posture and that dreadful hump?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pr-ii">
          <p class="">
            Hours spent on smart phones and laptops puts the head in an
            unnatural position...
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Add the effect of gravity, and this puts an additional 30kg of
            pressure on the neck. After a while muscles in the neck compensate,
            and this causes dreadful desk posture and even that "ugly neck
            hump", known medically as "Dowager's Hump".
          </p>
          <p class="">The problem here is two fold:</p>
          <p class="">
            1) Desk posture and neck hump can make you feel old, unattractive,
            helpless AND absolutely shatter confidence.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            2) If left untreated, there can be severe long-term consequences
            like dreadful chronic pain OR risky and expensive surgery.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-5 pb-3">HOW TO SOLVE THE NECK HUMP PROBLEM</h3>
          <p class="">
            If you’re worried about desk posture and neck hump, then it’s
            important to get ergonomic furniture, especially if you're working
            long hours at a desk.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            And according the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, it is possible to
            reverse the impacts of this condition through regular physical
            therapy sessions and adherence to a rigorous exercise and stretching
            program.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Unfortunately, when you add full-time work, social commitments,
            taking care of children and other life priorities it's not exactly
            easy to find a spare hour each day for a stretching and exercise
            program.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Not to mention how expensive life has gotten, so you're excused if
            you don't have a spare few hundred dollars a week to spend on
            physical therapy...
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Luckily, there's a breakthrough new medical device that’s definitely
            helping to solve this problem.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            It’s helping people gain relief from desk posture, dowager's hump
            and chronic neck pain. It’s called the
            <a href="/">Neck Cloud™</a> Cervical Traction Device and over 90,000
            people have left positive reviews. Full details are below

            Dr. Story is an American Chiropractor who noticed a huge spike in
            poor posture, neck hump and chronic neck pain thanks to so many
            people working from home during the pandemic...
          </p>

            He barely had enough time to see them all, so he created an new
            medical device his patients could use at home instead of visiting
            his clinic 2-3 times a week.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-4 pb-4">
            The new device is called The <a href="#">Neck Cloud™</a>
          </h3>
          <p class="pt-2 pb-2">How does it work?</p>
          <p class="pt-2 pb-2">
            When people sit at a desk for extended periods, your head sits
            further forward than it should, and this puts an additional 30kg of
            pressure on the neck.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2 pb-2">
            And combining this with the impact of gravity compresses the spine,
            the result is that muscles compensate by shortening, causing the
            "rounding" of the neck and upper back AND ultimately the ugly desk
            posture and neck hump.
          </p>
          <div class="img-2 pt-4">
            <img
              src="img/4.gif"
              alt="Nature"
              class="responsive"

              height="400"

          </div>
          <p class="pt-3">
            The <a href="">Neck Cloud™</a> solves this problem by using
            "cervical traction", a fancy way of saying "stretching the neck at
            the correct angle" to target the root cause of the poor posture and
            restore the neck's natural curvature.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Once you use the <a href=""> Neck Cloud™</a>, a few things begin to
            happen: firstly, the deep stretch decompresses the spine and
            counteracts the effect of desk work...
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3">
            This increases the space between each disc in the vertebrae and
            releases pressure on nerves running through the neck, ultimately
            restoring the neck's natural posture and eliminating pain.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Secondly, acupressure points that run along the surface of the
            device target tight muscles in the back of the neck, it's just like
            getting a deep tissue massage.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3">
            With consistent use over a period of two weeks, the neck's natural
            curve will restore, that ugly neck hump will be gone and you will
            experience pain relief.

              Truth be told, that’s what I thought too! After using the device for 30 days, rest assured I can categorically say it isn’t a gimmick. Kenko Back are so confident in their <a href="">Neck Cloud™</a> device they even offer a crazy “results or full refund” 60 day, guarantee on every purchase. If you don’t get pain relief, you get a full refund.

              The <a href="">Neck Cloud™</a> uses cervical traction. I did some digging and cervical traction has been shown in peer-reviewed journals, like spine-journal and the orthopaedic & sports physical therapy journal to significantly improve neck pain.
